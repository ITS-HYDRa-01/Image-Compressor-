      Your privacy is extremely important to us. At Image Compressor, we want you to know exactly how your information is handled when you use our online image compression tool. We respect your personal data and ensure that it is never shared or stored outside your own device. All image compression happens **directly in your browser**, and no image is ever uploaded to our servers. This means your photos stay private and secure at all times.

      We do not collect any personal information unless you voluntarily provide it to contact us. We do not track your usage for any purpose other than improving website performance. Cookies are not used to track individual users. We do use minimal technical cookies for site functionality, but these do not contain personal data.
